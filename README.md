A piecewise linear regression model using k-means clustering and primal SVR

Note: A k-means clustering is run before applying SVR in each local region. Parameters such as the number of cluster regions, C and epsilon should be well tuned. Clustered SVR shows superior regression quality in terms of MSE and CPU time.

Run "demo.m" to get a taste of the model.
